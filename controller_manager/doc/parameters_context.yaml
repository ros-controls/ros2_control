hardware_components_initial_state: |
    Map of parameters for controlled lifecycle management of hardware components.
    The names of the components are defined as attribute of ``<ros2_control>``-tag in ``robot_description``.
    Hardware components found in ``robot_description``, but without explicit state definition will be immediately activated.
    Detailed explanation of each parameter is given below.
    The full structure of the map is given in the following example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        hardware_components_initial_state:
          unconfigured:
            - "arm1"
            - "arm2"
          inactive:
            - "base3"

diagnostics.threshold.controllers.periodicity: |
  The ``periodicity`` diagnostics will be published only for the asynchronous controllers, because any affect to the synchronous controllers will be reflected directly in the controller manager's periodicity.

diagnostics.threshold.controllers.execution_time: |
  The ``execution_time`` diagnostics will be published for all controllers. The ``mean_error`` for a synchronous controller will be computed against zero, as it should be as low as possible. However, the ``mean_error`` for an asynchronous controller will be computed against the controller's desired update period, as the controller can take a maximum of the desired period cycle to execute it's update cycle.
