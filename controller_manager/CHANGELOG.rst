2.2.0 (2022-01-24)
------------------
* Resource Manager API changes for hardware lifecycle #api-breaking #abi-breaking (`#589 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/issues/589>`_)
  * Towards selective starting and stoping of hardware components. Cleaning and renaming.

  * Keep old api to start/activate all components per default.
  * Remove 'moving'/'non-moving' interface-handling.

------------------
* Fix update rate issues by working around MutliThreadedExecutor (`#275 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/issues/275>`_)
  * Fix update rate issues by working around MutliThreadedExecutor
  Currently the MutliThreadedExecutor performance is very bad. This leads
  to controllers not meeting their update rate. This PR is a temporary
  workaround for these issues.
  The current approach uses a `rclcpp` timer to execute the control loop.
  When used in combination with the `MutliThreadedExecutor`, the timers
  are not execute at their target frequency. I've converted the control
  loop to a while loop on a separate thread that uses `nanosleep` to
  execute the correct update rate. This means that `rclcpp` is not
  involved in the execution and leads to much better performance.
